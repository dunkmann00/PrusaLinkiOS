# PrusaLinkiOS

iOS app to access PrusaLink from your Prusa printer on your local network.

What this app does is pretty self explanatory...access PrusaLink. You can enter
the IP address of your printer, along with your username and password, and the
app will authenticate with the printer and load the web UI.

The main reason I made this app was because PrusaLink doesn't seem to load when
I try to open it in Safari on my iPhone. Partly due to not wanting to have to
install a different browser just to view PrusaLink, and partly due to me being
curious if WebKit (which is what Safari uses) could in fact load PrusaLink, I
made the app. And everything works just fine.

If you have any issues or suggestions please do open an issue in this repo!

This project is not affiliated in any way with Prusa. This is my own app that I
wanted to make and wanted to share as an Open Source project for others to be
able to see the source code and use/manipulate however they like.
